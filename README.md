## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ my name is Isaac!  I am a Data Engineer and Indie Game Developer
---

I love working with data, developing games and simulations.  If what I do helps 
at least one person then I am happy.
My goal is to utilize free open-source technology and software because I believe
FOST/FOSS is a great way to achieve my tasks. Some FOSS I currently use is
Godot Game Engine for games and simulations, Apache tools for automated data tasks and
MySQL and PostgreSQL for database tasks.

## TECH TREE
- **Languages** | Python, GDScript, C#, C++, SQL
- **Libraries** | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Database** | SQLite3, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Tools** | Git, VS Code, cmd prompt, bash and powershell
- **Game Engine** | Godot, PyGame
- **OS** | Windows and Linux

## Portfolio
You can view my portfolio [here](https://isaacfearn.com/).  I will add more of my projects and work
overtime.


ðŸ”­ [Curiosity Photos](https://isaacfearn.com/curiosityphotos/) is a web application that fetches data from NASA's rover API 
and displays an image that the Curiosity rover has taken on Mars.  Users can select a date and a camera to view from and shows
the user the first picture in the data's list.
