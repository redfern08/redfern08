## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I am Isaac!  Full stack and indie game developer
---

I am a passionate software developer, focused on building applications that will help
humanity, whether it is for healthcare or space exploration, I am fulfilled with making an
impact.  Previously, I was a commercial truck driver.  I spent six years hauling many things, 
keeping the flow of goods moving so that people were getting what they needed to survive.  Ultimately
I wanted to make a career change and continue making an impact.  Software development has given me 
the opportunity to continue making a difference and ensuring that people can obtain what they need.

ðŸ”­ [Curiosity Photos](https://isaacfearn.com/curiosityphotos/) is a web application that fetches data from NASA's rover API 
and displays an image that the Curiosity rover has taken on Mars.  Users can select a date and a camera to view from and shows
the user the first picture in the data's list.
